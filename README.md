# Quiz-app
A Quiz App allows users to participate in interactive quizzes with real-time feedback and scoring. The frontend is built using modern frameworks like ReactJS for dynamic UI, ensuring a seamless user experience, while the backend (e.g., FastAPI or Node.js) manages user data, quiz questions, and results securely with API endpoints.
